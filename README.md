I am passionate about leveraging data and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems, with a solid background in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **AI development**. My main programming language is **Python**, and I frequently use frameworks and libraries such as **Django**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**. For data analysis and visualization, **Power BI** and **Excel** are my go-to tools. I utilize **SQL** extensively for querying, cleaning, and transforming data in databases, ensuring robust data pipelines and insights. I also rely on Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration.
